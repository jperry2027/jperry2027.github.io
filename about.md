## About Me

I’m a Civil Engineering student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, with a focus on applying data-driven solutions to real-world infrastructure challenges.

My experience spans both construction sites and fast-paced service environments, where I’ve developed strong problem-solving, adaptability, and teamwork skills—qualities I bring into every project I tackle. As a first-generation college student, I’m motivated to explore new opportunities that foster growth, innovation, and community impact.

I’m especially interested in transportation systems, infrastructure resilience, and the role of engineering in sustainable community development.
